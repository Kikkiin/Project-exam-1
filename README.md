## Getting Started

### Installing

This project was developed using Local by Flywheel, exported, coded using Visual Studio Code, and then set up on a live server. Follow these steps to replicate or set up the project:

1. Setup Local by flywheel:
    - Download and install Local by Flywheel.
    - Create a new WordPress site in Local by Flywheel.

2. Clone the repo:
    - Clone the project's GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/project-exam-1-Kikkiin
```
    - Copy the contents from the repository into the corresponding WordPress site in Local by Flywheel (typically into the wp-content folder).

3. Custom development with vscode: 
    - Use Visual Studio Code to open the cloned repository and make any necessary code changes.

4. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

5. Import database:
    - Use Local by Flywheel to import the SQL file containing the website's database.


Live Server Setup

1. Prepare Live Server:
    - Ensure you have a web server with WordPress support (like one.com).
    - Install WordPress on the server.

2. Upload Content:
    - Use FileZilla or a similar FTP program to upload the wp-content folder from your local WordPress installation to the server.
    - Upload the SQL database to the server's database.

3. Update WordPress Configuration:
    - Update the wp-config.php on the server with the correct database connection details.
    - If the website's URL has changed (from local to live), update the URL in the database. 

4. Test the Website:
    - Once everything is set up, thoroughly test the website to ensure everything is functioning correctly on the live server.
